## Introduction to Roblox Lighting

Roblox offers a powerful lighting system that allows developers to create immersive environments. Understanding how to manipulate light sources and settings can drastically improve the visual quality and atmosphere of your games.

## Types of Lights

### Ambient Lighting

Ambient lighting provides overall illumination to the scene and sets the base level of brightness.

### Point Lights

Point lights emit light in all directions from a specific point in space. They are useful for simulating light sources such as lamps or torches.

### Spotlights

Spotlights emit light in a cone-shaped direction, allowing for more focused illumination. They are great for highlighting specific areas or objects.

### Surface Lights

Surface lights emit light from a surface, such as a glowing texture or a neon sign.

## Settings and Parameters

Roblox lighting settings can be adjusted using the Properties window in Studio. Key parameters include:

- **Color**: Adjust the color of the light emitted.
- **Brightness**: Control the intensity of the light.
- **Range**: Define how far the light extends.
- **Shadow Softness**: Adjust the softness of shadows cast by the light.

## Tips for Effective Lighting

- **Use Multiple Light Sources**: Combine different types of lights to create depth and realism.
- **Experiment with Colors**: Use contrasting colors to create mood and atmosphere.
- **Utilize Shadows**: Shadows add depth to your scenes and enhance realism.
- **Consider Time of Day**: Adjust lighting settings to simulate different times of day or weather conditions.
