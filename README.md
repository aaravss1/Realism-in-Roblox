# Realism-in-Roblox

## At its core, realism in Roblox encompasses several facets. One prominent aspect is the graphical fidelity and attention to detail in game design. Developers utilize advanced scripting techniques and high-quality assets to create environments that mimic real-world locations or historical settings. Whether it's a bustling cityscape with skyscrapers towering overhead, or a serene countryside dotted with farms and rolling hills, the visual realism in Roblox adds depth and immersion to the gameplay.

## Moreover, realism extends beyond visuals to include gameplay mechanics and simulations. Many games within Roblox incorporate realistic physics, weather systems, and day-night cycles, which enhance the authenticity of the virtual experience. For instance, driving simulations may feature realistic vehicle handling and road conditions, while survival games might simulate hunger, thirst, and environmental hazards.

## Every Roblox game's approach to realism is different is what I am trying to say, in my opinion, In roblox there are mainly 3 things that create true lighting.

# Lighting 


# Mechanics


# Assets
